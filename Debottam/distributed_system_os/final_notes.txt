Q. What is Distributed System?
-> Distributed system is a system that consist of multiple independent components that communicate and 
   coordinate with each other to achieve a common goal. These components can be located on different machines 
   or nodes, and they work together to provide a unified service or application.
   
   Simply different nodes that can be geographically distributed and can communicate
   with each other over a network and works for a common goal and acts like single endpoint/node.

Q. What is the difference between Distributed System and Parallel System?
-> 1. A distributed system consists of multiple independent nodes that communicate over a network, while a parallel system
   consists of multiple processors that work together on a single task, often sharing memory. 
   2. In a distributed system, nodes can be geographically dispersed and may not share memory (low coupling), 
   while in a parallel system, processors are typically located within the same machine and share memory.

Q. What are the advantages of Distributed System?
-> 1. Scalability: Distributed systems can easily scale by adding more nodes to handle increased workloads or users.
   2. Fault Tolerance: If one node fails, the system can continue to operate using other nodes, improving reliability.
   3. Resource Sharing: Nodes can share resources such as storage and processing power, leading to more efficient use of resources.
   4. Geographic Distribution: Components can be located in different geographical locations, allowing for better performance and availability.

Q. What are the disadvantages of Distributed System?
-> 1. Complexity: Designing and managing distributed systems can be complex due to the need for coordination and communication between nodes.
   2. Network Latency: Communication over a network can introduce delays, affecting performance.
   3. Security: Distributed systems can be more vulnerable to security threats due to the multiple points of access.
   4. Debugging and Testing: Identifying and fixing issues in a distributed system can be more challenging than in a centralized system.

Q. What are the key characteristics of Distributed System?
->  1. Transparency: The system should hide the complexity of the distributed nature from users and applications, making it appear as a single coherent system.
    2. Scalability: The system should be able to handle an increasing number of nodes and users without significant performance degradation.
    3. Fault Tolerance: The system should continue to operate even if some nodes fail, ensuring high availability.
    4. Resource Sharing: Nodes should be able to share resources such as data, processing power, and storage efficiently.
    5. Concurrency: Multiple nodes can operate simultaneously, allowing for parallel processing and improved performance.

Q. What are the types of Distributed System?
->  1. Client-Server Model: In this model, clients request services from servers, which provide the requested resources or services. The server is responsible for managing resources and handling requests.
    2. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Model: In a P2P system, all nodes (peers) have equal roles and can act as both clients and servers, sharing resources directly with each other.
    3. Multi-tier Architecture: This architecture separates different functionalities into distinct layers or tiers, such as presentation, application logic, and data storage, allowing for better organization and scalability.
    4. Distributed Databases: These systems store data across multiple nodes, allowing for distributed data management and access.
    5. Cloud Computing: A form of distributed system that provides on-demand access to computing resources over the internet, allowing users to scale resources as needed.

Q. User mobility in Distributed System?
-> User mobility refers to the ability of users to access distributed systems from different locations and devices.
   This is facilitated by the use of mobile devices, laptops, and other portable technologies that allow users to connect to the system over the internet or other networks. 
   User mobility enhances the accessibility and flexibility of distributed systems, enabling users to work from anywhere while maintaining access to resources and services.

Q. What is User Transparency in Distributed System?
-> User transparency in a distributed system refers to the ability of the system to hide the complexities of
   its distributed nature from users. This means that users can interact with the system as if it were a single, unified entity, without needing to be aware of the underlying distribution of components or resources.
   User transparency includes aspects such as 
   i. location transparency (users do not need to know where resources are located), 
   ii. replication transparency (users do not need to know about multiple copies of resources), and 
   iii. failure transparency (users can continue to operate without being affected by node failures).

Q. Loose Coupling and Tight Coupling in Distributed System?
-> Loose coupling refers to a design where components of a distributed system are independent and communicate through well-defined interfaces, allowing for flexibility and scalability. 
   In loose coupling, changes to one component do not significantly affect others, enabling easier maintenance and updates.

   Tight coupling, on the other hand, refers to a design where components are closely linked and dependent on each other. 
   In tight coupling, changes in one component can have a significant impact on others, making the system less flexible and harder to maintain. 
   Tight coupling is generally avoided in distributed systems to promote modularity and ease of development.
